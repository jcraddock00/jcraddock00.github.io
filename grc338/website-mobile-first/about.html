        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2006 by Tyler "Tito" Fischer and his beautiful wife, Savannah, the dream was to create a low-key, chill eatery for their hometown of Laguna Beach, California. Tyler grew up surfing with his buddies and their after-shred treat was to always go to the local taco shop and grab a bite to eat. When Tyler learned that their typical spot was closing down for good, Tyler knew that he had to start something special, so the kids of tomorrow would be able to enjoy the same traditions that he got to growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, when he and Savannah got married in 2000, they were right out of college, both having degrees in business administration, so they decided to take their dreams and make them a reality. Construction began on Tito's in 2003, right where Tyler's favorite taco stand once stood, and on March 25, 2006, Tito's was open to the public, serving recipes that had travelled through both of their families for generations, as well as the original taco recipes that Tyler loved so much growing up. 
        <p>
            There's nothing that Tyler and Savannah love more than serving the surfers, the locals, and even the tourists of Laguna Beach, and business has been booming since that sunshine-filled day in 2006.
