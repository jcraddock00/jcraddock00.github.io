                                <p>San Luis Obispo is home to some of the most beautiful views in the Central Coast. Nestled just 2 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, SLO has everything from gorgeous mountain views to beautiful ocea sunsets.  </p>

                                <p>Want to get a whiff of that salty ocean air? Morro Bay is a short 20 minute drive north of SLO. Simply get on highway 1 (yes, the same one that snakes up the entirety of the California coastline) and take the Morro Bay exit and you'll be there! Catch a sunset, catch a wave, or cach a glimpse of some sea otters swimming in the bay, you'll be guaranteed to smile.</p>

                                <p>In my opinion, the best time to visit Morro Bay is in the wee morning hours right around sunrise. It might be a little cold because it's more exposed to the elements being the northmost point of San Luis Bay, but the sunsets and tranquility are unmatched. There is nothing quite like the peacefulness that comes with getting up early and observing the wildlife wake up with the sun, not to mention the painted skies that com with sunrise. Morro Bay is truly a natural treat. </p>

                                <p>One of the best things about San Luis Obispo is the stargazing. Due to its remote location on the Central Coast, SLO doesn't have to battle light polution in order to see the gorgeous skies light up the darkness. My personal favorite spot to stargaze would be Perfumo Canyon, accessible right off of Los Osos Valley Road. This is a tiny little mountain road that winds through the frontfacing valley that separates SLO from the ocean, and it gets you far enough away from the city that yu can see most stars with the naked eye, though having a nice camera would help too! </p>
