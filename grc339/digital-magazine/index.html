                                    San Luis Obispo is home to dozens of hotels located all around town that vary in price point, luxury accomoadations, and locations, including the iconic Madonna Inn.

                                <p> 
                                    Due to San Luis Obispo's iconic location in the Central Coast, the 101 Freeway runs directly through town. This major freeway runs the majority of the California coast and connects with most major highways, so driving to and from SLO is a very convienent travel plan. We also have a small regional airport that flies direct to LA, SF, Denver, and Dallas, along with other major cities. Finally, we are a key stop on the AmTrak path too!
